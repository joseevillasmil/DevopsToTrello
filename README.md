# DevopsToTrello
Project Deviop to Trello.

This project aims to connect devops and trello boards.
The original problem was that i need to see my devops tasks in my tablet but there's no official application in the playstore to see devops tasks, only third party apps.
So, I decided to create a webservice that connect both boards by using API REST integration.

You'll need:
 - Trello ApiKey
 - Trello Token
 - Trello Board Id
 - Trello memeber Id (this is your user memeber ID, an ID to your user into trelo board)
 - Devops Token
 - Devops Organization
 - Devops Project
 - Devops Query
